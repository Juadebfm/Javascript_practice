# Javascript Practice

This is a practice project for improving basic DOM manipulation skills required for web development. It should ideally be one of the first things you learn as a frontend developer.

## Content

Use resources from [w3school.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp) to understand the fundamentals of Javascript as a programming language very effective in web development.

<!-- ```bash
pip install foobar
``` -->

<!-- ##  -->

<!-- ```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
``` -->

## What iʻll gain
If I commit to this as I have committed to every other aspect of my frontend web development journey, I will solidly step into my dream of becoming a full stack developer soon.
